**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**
My role in this assignment was to develop an algorithm that lets the machine agent find the most efficient pathway from the start of the grid in the top-left to the finish in the bottom right. The agent will continue to run as many epochs as needed until the success rate has reached 100%. The grid and layout of the game was provided in the assignment rubric and guidelines. The only piece of code that I needed to create myself was the algorithm.  

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
Computer scientists creat algorithms and pieces of code that complete their intended tasks efficiently. Specifically, they innovate previous designs and help theri programs learn from past mistakes. This is the basis of machine learning: To let machines learn from experience and make decisions based on given input or learned experiences. This is important because AI is being implemented in many placed in everyday life. To do so without first testing it for efficiency can disbenefit users or even put them in danger. 

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
Computer scientists need to approach problems with a sense of realism. I believe this emans going in assuming that there is always going to be a more efficient solution to a problem that has yet to eb discovered. This mindset has pushed computer scientists to create AI and expand their functionality. To assume that something does not need to be improved just because it solves the problem at hand means to be stagnant.  

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
My ethical responsibilities to the user and organization are to ensure that their perosnal data is never compromised. Machine learning is an increduble thing, but to innovate without it benefiting humans defeats the purpose. In the long run, this will cost everyone a great deal of time and money. Operating within ethical boundaries and following any guidelines is crucial for keeping users safe and happy with the end product.
